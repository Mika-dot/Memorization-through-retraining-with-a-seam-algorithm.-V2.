Memorization through retraining with a seam algorithm V2. 

An attempt to train a neural network to archive an image. 
The bottom line is that it is intelligent archiving. 
The seam cutting algorithm calculates the low-energy pixels and then the neural network memorizes them. 
An attempt was made by the user foo52. 
The layers were stripped from it. 2 x y neurons and 3 output neurons.

The network takes a photo from the img folder under the number specified in the ling variable. Saves the results in this folder under the photo name.
I have not figured out the choice of neurons, their number. There is help in the description of the NeuralNetworkV2 library, as well as links to the forum with asked questions on this topic.
