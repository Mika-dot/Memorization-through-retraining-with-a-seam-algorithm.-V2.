An attempt to train a neural network to archive an image. The bottom line is that it is intelligent archiving. The seam cutting algorithm calculates the low-energy pixels and then the neural network memorizes them. An attempt was made by the user foo52. The layers were taken from him. 2 neurons x y 100 neurons 100 neurons 100 neurons 3 neurons r g b
